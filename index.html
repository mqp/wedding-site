          <h1>Wedding information</h1>
          <p>Thanks for thinking to come to our wedding! We would be happy to see you.</p>
          <p>The ceremony is in Cincinnati, at the <a href="http://www.contemporaryartscenter.org/visit/directions-parking">Contemporary Art Center</a> (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Contemporary+Arts+Center/@39.1028135,-84.5141976,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!3m1!2sContemporary+Arts+Center!3m4!1s0x8841b150a5d8826f:0xb6b49e2790259e3b!8m2!3d39.1028133!4d-84.5120086">map</a>), on Saturday, May 19th, at 6 PM. It might take
            half an hour. The reception will be there afterward, with dinner and drinks and hanging around. It will be a
            pretty normal kind of wedding. There will be some tables set up for board games, so if there is a
            board game you would like to play, feel free to bring it.</p>

         <h1>RSVP by April 19th</h1>
          <p>Regardless of whether you plan to attend, an RSVP would be appreciated. Please either return the RSVP card
          from your your invitation, or email <a href="mailto:carolinebuckey@gmail.com">carolinebuckey@gmail.com</a> with
          the number of guests. We will have both an alcoholic bar and a non-alcoholic bar if there is enough interest,
          so please let us know how many guests would prefer the non-alcoholic bar if it is available. Either returning
          the RSVP card or sending an email is enough. No need to do both!</p>

        <section id="accomodations">
          <h1>Accomodations</h1>
          <p>The CAC is right in the middle of downtown, so there are a lot of hotels nearby you can stay at.
          We had trouble arranging block reservations or group discounts, though, because of a home Reds game that
          weekend. We recommend booking your hotel room early if you want a hotel downtown!</p>

          <p>We were able to get a block at the 21c Museum Hotel in Cincinnati, which is right next door the Contemporary
          Art Center. They are a bit pricier than many other hotels downtown, though. The group rate they offered is $239          a night. To get this rate, book at <a href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=56599&Chain=7748&arrive=5/18/2018&depart=5/20/2018&adult=1&child=0&group=BQWED18">this link</a>
          and use group code BQWED18, or call <a href="tel:+8445775542">844-577-5542</a> and mention the Buckey and
          Quander wedding by April 18th. If the block runs out, let us know and we may be able to extend it.</p>

        <section id="dress-code">
          <h1>Dress code</h1>
          <p>We don't care what you wear at all. The wedding party will be wearing nice clothes, but not traditional
          wedding attire. Caroline's dress is bright pink! A nice shirt and pants would be completely reasonable, or
          whatever you feel comfortable in.</p>

        <section id="registry">
          <h1>Registry</h1>
          <p>We didn't make a registry because we don't expect or want any gifts. We are very excited to celebrate
          our wedding with any of our friends and family who can attend! No other gifts are desired.</p>
