          <p>Thanks for thinking to come to our wedding! We would be happy to see you.</p>
          <p>The ceremony is in Cincinnati, at the <a href="http://www.contemporaryartscenter.org/visit/directions-parking">Contemporary Art Center</a> (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Contemporary+Arts+Center/@39.1028135,-84.5141976,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!3m1!2sContemporary+Arts+Center!3m4!1s0x8841b150a5d8826f:0xb6b49e2790259e3b!8m2!3d39.1028133!4d-84.5120086">map</a>), on Saturday, May 19th, at 6 PM. It might take
            half an hour. The reception will be there afterward, with dinner and drinks and hanging around. It will be a
            pretty normal kind of wedding.</p>

          <p>Regardless of whether you plan to attend, an RSVP would be appreciated. See our <a href="#contact">contact information</a>
            at the bottom of this page. (We accept RSVPs via electronic mail!) Please let us know how many people are coming

        <section id="accomodations">
          <h1>Accomodations</h1>
          <p>The CAC is right in the middle of downtown, so there are a lot of hotels nearby you can stay at,
            and there should be a lot of parking nearby that's easy to use, so you should be able to do whatever is
            convenient.</p>
          <p>TODO: fill in courtesy blocks and hotel parking we obtain.</p>

        <section id="dress-code">
          <h1>Dress code</h1>
          <p>We don't care what you wear at all. We plan to wear stuff less formal than maximum wedding
            formality ourselves. If I were you, I would wear a nice shirt and pants.</p>

            give whatever you would have spent to a charity that you endorse.</p>
